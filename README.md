## ♟️ 1D Chess with Reinforcement Learning

### What?

**1D chess** is a simplified variant of traditional chess, played on a single row of squares instead of a full board. The game is much smaller in complexity and, in its basic form, has already been solved — making it an interesting sandbox for testing algorithms.

### How?

In this project, I:
- Built the entire 1D chess game environment from scratch in Python, including move rules, turn-based logic, and endgame conditions.
- Implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to play the game autonomously.
- Enabled interactive gameplay between a human and the trained agent.

The training process allows the agent to learn optimal strategies over time through self-play and rewards.

### Why?

My motivation was to **deeply understand reinforcement learning** by applying it to a manageable, interpretable problem. 1D chess offered the right balance between simplicity and strategic depth, helping me gain practical experience in implementing, training, and evaluating RL agents from the ground up.
